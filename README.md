# ETLsAreEasy
How creating ETLs is very easy, for most of the companies it is what will fulfill their needs. 

The reason of doing this: 
Many companies ask me if I know Informatica or SSIS, I tell them, I have been creating ETLs for more than 9 years now using programing languages like Perl, R, PowerShell.
My ETLs work quite well, they are fast and eficient. 
I think the question they ask is like to ask an accountant if they have used LibreOffice Calc

Here I am using R as an example.
Why R?: R can be used mainly as an statistical language, but to do that it needs to be good at data handling and it is good.
Specializing in R will also help you to see all the advanced analytics things you can do with it.
Also you will see some of functional programming.
R has a very big community.

For databases I will be using SQLite with R package RSQLite(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSQLite/vignettes/RSQLite.html)
and Apache Derby(https://db.apache.org/derby/) with JDBC driver to show two different databases and two different methods to access a database.
Although Apache Derby allows to have a client/server mode (which I have used for concurrency), I will only use the embeded driver here.

Here a link to download JDBC drivers for what they call common databases:
