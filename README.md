# ETLsAreEasy
There are different ways to create ETLs, here I am showing different ways by using different programming languages.

The reason of doing this: 
Many companies ask me if I know Informatica or SSIS, I tell them, I have been creating ETLs for more than 9 years now using programing languages like Perl, R, PowerShell and JavaScript.
These ETLs work well, they are fast and eficient.
